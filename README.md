# Book-Review-Using-NLP
This project applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze and classify the sentiment of book reviews. The goal is to automatically determine whether a review expresses positive, negative, or neutral sentiment by combining traditional NLP preprocessing with both rule-based and machine learning approaches.
